As a customer, I want to easily book a table online through the restaurant's website. So that I can ensure that there is a table available for me without the need to call the restaurant.

1. User-Friendly Interface - The booking system should have an easy to use interface, allowing customers to select the date, time and number of guests for the reservation. 
2. Confirmation system - The booking system should provide instant feedback to the user that their booking has been successful, including reservation details. 
3. Modification - Customers should have the ability to modify or cancel their reservation.
Special requests - The user should have an optional field for special requests (for example: dietary issues, birthday wishes).
